	<p>Hey there! My name is Anjala Yadavalli, and I am a second-year Management Information Systems major at the University of Georgia. I am from Alpharetta, Georgia, and I am 19 years old. I am from India, and I moved to the United States when I was just 5 years old! I have lived in a small town in South Carolina, in Marietta, Georgia, and Alpharetta, Georgia. My family currently stays in Alpharetta, and I visit home every other weekend or so! My hobbies include watching a ton of TV, spending time with my family and friends, and playing with my puppy, Jack!

	<p>I started studying at the University of Georgia in Fall of 2016, and I got into the Terry College of Business in Fall of 2017. The Management Information Systems major at UGA is one of the top in the nation, and it is very tough to get into. I am excited yet nervous to start taking my major-level courses next year. On November 13, 2017, I registered for my class schedule for next semester, Spring 2018. Here is a look at my schedule for next semester:</p>
